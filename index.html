        movement. As it is targeted at mobile phones with poor network
        connectivity (as well as for desktop perusal), it uses the compact
        <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">LeafletJS</a>
        mapping API (smaller than OpenLayers or GoogleMaps APIs), avoids
        unnecessary inclusion of libraries (such as jQuery) and features
        JavaScript "minification" at build time. Although usable before all
        data (and info pane image thumbnails) have loaded it continues to
        load all of these asynchronously in the background in order for
        popups and information panes to render quickly during continued
        operation. Map tiles at multiple zoom levels must be loaded
        dynamically (though are cached by the browser). It takes advantage
        of the responsive design features of the sidebar plugin so that
        information pane sidebars (desktop) become full screen (mobile).

        This is an implementation of an original algorithm to create a
        "synthetic data set" that is an estimate of the numbers of workers
        commuting between their home area (origin) and place of work
        (destination), based on constraints derived from 2011 Census of
        England and Wales data. Specifically, it generates Synthetic Flow
        Data between census Output Areas (OA) and Workplace Zones (WZ) based
        on tables of total commuters from each OA and from each WZ, combined
        with spatial data to derive commute distance. This was developed as
        part of my MSc dissertation as the actual data was not (and still
        isn't publicly) available.

        This was an experiment in developing an interactive software
        environment to explore the effects of varying input parameters for a
        behavioural model: stepping through time in a simulator whilst
        rendering simulator state as a simple 2D bar chart, with cumulative
        results rendered in a more sophisticated manner (using the
        <a href="https://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/" target="_blank">
            JFreeChart</a> library).
        The actual model used was a (rather simplistic) behavioural model
        of trade-offs between commuting by car or bike. The
        tabbed GUI was implemented using the Java
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html"
           target="_blank">Swing</a> toolkit.
        This project was developed as a free-choice assignment in my MSc course.
